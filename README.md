# Python-Challenge

---

## Description

In this assignment, will use the concepts learned to complete two Python challenges, PyBank and PyPoll. Both tasks present a real-world situation where your newly developed Python scripting skills come in handy.

## Analysis and background for PyBank

### Background

In this Challenge, we were tasked with creating a Python script to analyze the financial records of your company. Was given a financial dataset called budget_data.csv. The dataset is composed of two columns: "Date" and "Profit/Losses".

### Analysis

Created a Python script that analyzed the records to calculate the following values:
The total number of months included in the dataset
The net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period
The changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period, and then the average of those changes
The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period
The greatest decrease in profits (date and amount) over the entire period
The final script printed the analysis output to the terminal and exported a text file with the results to the Analysis folder.

## Analysis and background for PyPoll

### Background

Was given a set of poll data called election_data.csv. The dataset is composed of three columns: "Voter ID", "County", and "Candidate". Our task is to create a Python script that analyzes the votes and calculates the below values.

### Anaysis

Created a Python script that analyzed the votes and calculated each of the following values:
The total number of votes cast
A complete list of candidates who received votes
The percentage of votes each candidate won
The total number of votes each candidate won
The winner of the election based on popular vote
The final script printed the analysis output to the terminal and exported a text file with the results to the Analysis folder.
